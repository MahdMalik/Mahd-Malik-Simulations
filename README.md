WHERE TO PLACE EACH FILE:
- H97Jthrustcurve.eng: place this wherever you want as long as you change the pathfile inside the Jupyter notebook to match the pathway for this thrust curve. I recommend putting it inside the Rocketpy folder

- L1MotorOff.csv: same as above where you have to watch the pathfile name, I also recommend placing this in the same RocketPy folder

- L1MotorOn.csv: same as above

- WeatherData.xlsx: same as above

- SeymourLaunchSite: same as above

- SpaceportLaunchSite: same as above

- L1Rocket.CDX1: anywhere you need to, this is the file for RasAero and the one for the L1 Rocket

- L1Rocket.ork: same as above, but this is the OpenRocket File for my L1 Rocket

- L1RocketSim.ipynb: place this in the same folder as the RocketPy folder, as the folder doesn't seem to run unless it's in the same folder as all the RocketPy classes.

- flight_plots.py: for this one, you should find the same "flight_plots.py" file INSIDE the RocketPy folder, and REPLACE THAT FILE with this one.

- Environment.py: same as above, replace the original Environment.py folder with this one as well

- flight.py: same as above too
