WHERE TO PLACE EACH FILE:

K570-17A.eng: place this wherever you want as long as you change the pathfile inside the Jupyter notebook to match the pathway for this thrust curve. I recommend putting it inside the Rocketpy folder

ETRCDOFF.csv: same as above where you have to watch the pathfile name, I also recommend placing this in the same RocketPy folder

ETRCDON.csv: same as above

WeatherData.xlsx: same as above

SeymourLaunchSite: same as above

SpaceportLaunchSite: same as above

L2Rocket.CDX1: anywhere you need to, this is the file for RasAero and the one for the L2 Rocket

L2RocketSim.ipynb: place this in the same folder as the RocketPy folder, as the folder doesn't seem to run unless it's in the same folder as all the RocketPy classes.

flight_plots.py: for this one, you should find the same "flight_plots.py" file INSIDE the RocketPy folder, and REPLACE THAT FILE with this one.

Environment.py: same as above, replace the original Environment.py folder with this one as well

flight.py: same as above too
